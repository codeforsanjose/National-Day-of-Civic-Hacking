## Have a project to Pitch?
1. Work on your project pitch. Here is a [slide deck with some helpful resources](https://stedwards.box.com/s/3tedclh520vfo1681j4qx91tfp453lmu) on crafting a 60 second pitch.
2. Create a new Github repo for your project. [need help?](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)
3. In your new repo, create a README file explaining the details of your project. Feel free to copy/paste from your project submission. But also try to make it concise. Imagine you are new to the project, what would help you get started? Here are some tips on [what should go on your README](http://atxhack4change.github.io/tech-and-tools/#/3/2).
4. Add Issues to your Github Repo to organize the tasks that your team will need to perform. [Here is some guidance](http://atxhack4change.github.io/tech-and-tools/#/3/4)
5. Use the [Civic Tech Planning Canvas](http://www.open-austin.org/civic-tech-canvas/) to flesh out your idea.
