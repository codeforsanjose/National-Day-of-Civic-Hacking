2. Create a new Github repo for your project under the Code for San Jose organization [need help?](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)
3. In your new repo, create a README file explaining the details of your project. Feel free to copy/paste from your project submission. But also try to make it concise. Imagine you are new to the project, what would help you get started? Here are some tips on [what should go on your README](http://atxhack4change.github.io/tech-and-tools/#/3/2).
